# balanced-BST
A ruby script for a balanced binary search tree implementation
## Descriptrion
This repo includes a class script for the node and tree classes, which together create a balanced binary search tree.
The tree class includes all the required methods as per TOP requirements, as well as some helper methods.
It also includes a driver script to test creation, insertion and rebalancing of the binary search tree.
## Thoughts
This was definitely a challange for me, though a fun one. It took me some time to visualize and figure out how each method should function and I spent a lot of time researching and reading the docs.
I tried to make the code as concise as possible, but it could still use some refactoring. Nevertheless, this project was a fun challange and I'm glad I've completed it.
